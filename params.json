{"name":"Renamemer","tagline":"Organize Your Memes","body":"renamemer\r\n===\r\n\r\nI wrote this thing for myself, and I've spent probably around eight hours\r\nworking on it in total. As such, it's not exactly a polished or complete\r\napplication. It should function as intended, but note that it theoretically has\r\nthe ability to move around all the files on your computer in a way that could\r\nbreak your OS install, like if you pointed it at System32 and started moving\r\njunk around, obviously that would be bad. What I'm saying is that there are no\r\nreal safeguards, but it's also just a really simple hacked together utility, so\r\nhopefully it doesn't cause too much trouble. It has exactly as many features as\r\nI wanted it to have for my own purposes at this point. That being said, if\r\nanybody else finds it useful and has suggestions or would like it to be a more\r\npolished experience, I'm open to all that.\r\n\r\nSo basically this thing enables you to organize a directory full of media files\r\nreally quickly. Here are some of its killer features:\r\n\r\n1. Preview common image and video formats (jpg, png, gif[with animation], bmp,\r\n   webm, ogg, avi, etc.)\r\n2. Intelligent keyboard-based control scheme\r\n3. bash-style tab completion of directory names\r\n4. It's got like a list thing on the right side of the files you're gonna\r\n   organize and uhh..\r\n5. You can go real fast\r\n\r\nBasically it makes it so that instead of having to like drag and drop files, or\r\nright-click -> rename or whatever, dealing with all that slow UI stuff, you\r\njust type and hit enter. In practice, by far the hardest part of organizing your\r\nmemes will be deciding on names for stuff.\r\n\r\nManual\r\n---\r\nYou're gonna want to read this because you will get no other instruction inside \r\nthe app. These are the things you want to do:\r\n\r\n1. Download the [release package](https://github.com/lyleunderwood/renamemer/releases/download/1.0.0/renamemer-1.0.0.Yui.win32.zip)\r\n2. If you want video previews you need to install codecs. I'm gonna assume the\r\n   target market for this either has already installed or knows how to install\r\n   a codec pack. If not, google it.\r\n3. Extract that bad boy and open up the `renamemer` folder\r\n4. Navigate into the `bin` directory and run `renamemer.exe`\r\n5. Choose the target / base directory. You can either do this by typing the\r\n   path in the Base Folder input or by going to File -> Browse something I\r\n   don't remember what it's called. Also tab completion works in the Base\r\n   Folder input, so you can start typing a folder name and hit TAB to complete\r\n   it. You'll want to get used to this mechanic. Hit ENTER when you're done\r\n   typing in the Base Folder and your cursor will drop down into the Filename\r\n   input so you can start renaming stuff.\r\n6. You should see a list of files on the right-hand side ordered by creation\r\n   date, and previews showing up under the inputs. You can click on stuff on\r\n   the right to select it and see the preview and stuff.\r\n7. If you start typing in the filename input, the name portion of the filename\r\n   will be replaced while the extension is retained. If you change the name and\r\n   hit ENTER the file will be renamed and removed from the list. If you hit\r\n   ENTER and the name is not different the file will just be skipped. If you\r\n   hit ESC at any time the filename will be reset in the input to the original\r\n   filename. If you add directories by doing like somedir/otherdir/file.png and hit\r\n   ENTER then the whole directory chain will be created automatically and the\r\n   file placed in it and renamed as necessary. Also, directory names can be\r\n   tab-completed, so you can do stuff like: anim _**tab**_ k- _**tab**_ rit \r\n   _**tab**_ and it'll fill in folder names for you.\r\n\r\nThat's basically it. So far this thing has been tested on win7 for less than\r\nfive minutes, but it's a pretty simple app so hopefully there aren't a ton of\r\nbugs all over the place. If you have problems then you might try running it in\r\nwindows 7 compatibility mode or whatever. Trying to package this for OSX would\r\nbe a huge pain in the ass so I'm not gonna do it.\r\n\r\nThere are some other possible features I've considered like sort of a folder\r\nhotkey system or something that shows you the possible folders when you have an\r\nambiguous tab completion, but we'll see.\r\n\r\nDevelopment\r\n---\r\nIf you want to actually build renamemer for any reason, just install QtCreator\r\nand open the .pro file and hit build.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
